# Predicting House Prices with Supervised Learning

This project is a practical example of using supervised machine learning to predict house prices. It generates a synthetic dataset, trains multiple regression models, compares performance, and prints model insights and example predictions.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (if you don't already have one):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe "Predicting House Prices with Supervised Learning.py"
```
